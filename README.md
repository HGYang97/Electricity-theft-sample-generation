Electricity theft poses a significant threat to the reliability and economic efficiency of smart grids. Although deep learning has shown promising results in electricity theft detection task, its effectiveness largely depends on the availability of high-quality labeled theft samples. To address the scarcity of real-world theft data, False Data Injection (FDI) functions have been widely used for sample generation. However, we systematically demonstrate that FDI-based methods have fundamental limitations, including statistical distribution shifts, cross-domain generalization, and the temporal patterns of theft behavior.
To overcome these issues, we propose three alternative sample generation paradigms: adversarial attack, style transfer, and diffusion-based generation, which aim to better fit the characteristics of real-world electricity theft behavior. Extensive experiments under in-domain, partially labeled, few-shot, and zero-label settings confirm the effectiveness of the proposed methods. This work provides new insights into data generation for electricity theft detection and lays the foundation for more robust and generalizable detection systems in practical smart grid deployments.
